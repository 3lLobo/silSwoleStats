# Sils Swoleness

An MVP WebApp to track Sil's clients Swoleness.

[![Wallaby.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/wallaby.js-powered-g.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://wallabyjs.com/oss/)

This page shall have double sided purpose:

-   for once, the client shall be able to log his stats
-   secondly, his data shall be visualized together with additional information.

Mockup data should be weight, big lifts and waist measurements for client data and protein/carbohydrate/fat caloric distribution for nutrition.

## Roadmap

1. Find nice template âœ…
1. Implement Graphic interface
1. Set up Database structure
1. Set up Auth with Google and LinkedIn
1. Populate with dummy data
1. Plot with D3

## Setup-so-far

Template: [Purity UI Dashboard](https://demos.creative-tim.com/purity-ui-dashboard)

Formating and Linting: [DevPost](https://dev.to/chgldev/getting-prettier-eslint-and-vscode-to-work-together-3678)

### Dashboard

The components are renderer [here](src/views/Dashboard/Dashboard/index.js).

We start with a Table for the **BIG LIFTS** and one for the bodyfat percentage.

**BIG LIFTS**:

-   Bench
-   Squat
-   Deadlift
-   Clean

table structure should looks like this:

| lift_id | user_id | lift_type | lift_weight | reps | date           |
| ------- | ------- | --------- | ----------- | ---- | -------------- |
| 1       | 11      | Bench     | 110         | 8    | 20220411-11:11 |

**Body composition**:

| weightin_id | user_id | weight_kg | bodyfat_perc | date           |
| ----------- | ------- | --------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| 1           | 11      | 111       | 11           | 20220411-11:11 |

### Tables

Here we want either the weekly checkin, or the food/meelplan graphs.

## React / NextJS and D3

Browsing the web we got along two different methods. Both rely on passing the D3 svg (`svg.node()`) to the `useRef()` React hook, then setting this ref as refference to either an `<svg />` or a `<div />` element. We didn't figure out yet how to use it with NextJS optimized `<Image />` component. Here the two alternatives:

-   Using [D3 inside a react hook](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/using-d3.js-inside-a-react-app). The chart gets rendered inside the `useD3()` hook and returns the ref object. Simple but too simple for challenges like component resizing and getting data in/out of the chart.
-   More complex solution by building a [D3 chart class](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/react-hooks-and-d3-39be1d900fb). Again the class takes a `ref` hook-element as input for the constructor which likes to the chart. The class can be enhanced with `onClick()` functions and further props. Inside the React component, events such as resizing or data updates are handled by React `useEffect()` hooks. Tricky is here the NextJS server-side renderer. We pass the React component as `dynamic` and opt out of SSR. Here a nice [gist](https://gist.github.com/stopyransky/fe3fd908055be08f2c8df4600962ff0e#file-reactcomponent-js)

On LinkedIn I saw a workshop video of a lady who also wrote a book on how to integrate D3 in React. Can't find it anymore ðŸ™„

TODO:

-   how to change the `<svg />` font and color.
-   pull data out of the chart to React

## Notes 2 myself

Don't try to configure ESLint your self!!! Use `npx create-next-app` instead and stick to the default.
Same for stroybook.

To redirect automatically from one page to another use [middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/middleware-relative-urls).

Allowing SVGs inside nexjs Image - [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#dangerously-allow-svg).

Changing or adding Fonts to the NextJS website:

-   Frst choose your font on [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat)
-   Next follow [these instructions](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization)
-   Only the last `<link />` tag is necessary. Don't forget to close the tag.
-   In ChakraUI, extand the theme with something like this:

```json
{styles: {
        global: (props) => ({
            body: {
                fontFamily: 'Montserrat, sans-serif',
            },
            html: {
                fontFamily: 'Montserrat, sans-serif',
            },
        }}}
```

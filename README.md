## Setup-so-far

Template: [Purity UI Dashboard](https://demos.creative-tim.com/purity-ui-dashboard)

Formating and Linting: [DevPost](https://dev.to/chgldev/getting-prettier-eslint-and-vscode-to-work-together-3678)


### Dashboard

The components are renderer [here](src/views/Dashboard/Dashboard/index.js).

We start with a Table for the **BIG LIFTS** and one for the bodyfat percentage.

**BIG LIFTS**:

-   Bench
-   Squat
-   Deadlift
-   Clean

table structure should looks like this:

| lift_id | user_id | lift_type | lift_weight | reps | date           |
| ------- | ------- | --------- | ----------- | ---- | -------------- |
| 1       | 11      | Bench     | 110         | 8    | 20220411-11:11 |

**Body composition**:

| weightin_id | user_id | weight_kg | bodyfat_perc | date           |
| ----------- | ------- | --------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| 1           | 11      | 111       | 11           | 20220411-11:11 |

### Tables

Here we want either the weekly checkin, or the food/meelplan graphs.
Edit the template [here](src/views/Dashboard/Tables/index.js)

## Notes 2 myself

Don't try to configure ESLint your self!!! Use `npx create-next-app` instead and stick to the default.
Same for stroybook. 

To redicrect automatically from one page to another use [middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/middleware-relative-urls).
